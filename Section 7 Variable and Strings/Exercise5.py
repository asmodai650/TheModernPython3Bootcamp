##Escape Sequence Practice
##Get some practice with escape sequences!
##NO need to create new variables, just use the existing variables we have created for you and follow the instructions. :) 

 # Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = "why \n not"


# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
mountains = "\/\/\\/\\"


# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark

quotation = "\"N\""
